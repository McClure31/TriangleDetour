# TriangleDetour
This is a collaberative beginners project that will host web designs and code for website development.
Most of my coding will be done with SQL and Java which are what I'm most comfortable with. I'll have some css as well. As far as frameworks
I'm going to experiment with Angular or Spring MVC.
I will add more to the README as the project develops.
